  ENTR 3100 - Industrial Landscape

  The course is an advanced level of entrepreneurship course in which students will work together as teams in putting out innovative projects in the context of the future of education.

  This course is experiential-based, where students apply design thinking to pick up skills; spend time in understanding the field of education to learn knowledge; and meet with different innovators to learn about entrepreneurial mindset.

  This particular session, students already learned about the empathy, defining and ideation of design thinking. They will be starting to learn about interacting with generative artificial intelligence (e.g. ChatGPT)  in researching, brainstorming and providing feedback. 

  They are working towards a fictional funding proposal on getting a 250K to implement an education innovation of their choice.
  
  Assume students in the class have a diverse background and majors.
