1. What is a common technique to shape the relevance of a generative AI model's response?

    A) Provide fewer details in the prompt to allow the AI freedom in generating the answer
    - Incorrect. Though giving the AI freedom can sometimes be beneficial, in many instances, a lack of detail can lead to vague or off-topic outputs. Remember: guiding the AI with concise and specific prompts is key.

    B) Use general and broad terms in the prompt, like 'tell me more about...'
    - Incorrect. While it's good to keep prompts open-ended, being too general or broad can lead to responses that lack deep specificity. It's often useful to strike a balance between leaving room for exploration and giving pointed direction.

    C) Provide the AI with a concise, clear prompt such as 'Summarize the key aspects of...'
    - Correct. Clear, direct prompts can greatly help the AI to generate highly relevant and focused output.

2. Imagine you are considering a decision for your startup. Which of the following actions reflect taking into account the potential ethical implications?

    A) Choosing to source materials from the cheapest supplier regardless of their labor practices
    - Incorrect. Although cost-effectiveness is crucial in managing a startup, it's equally important to consider the social and ethical impact of your actions. It's often best to consider suppliers with fair labor practices, aligning with ethical entrepreneurship principles.

    B) Prioritizing operational efficiency by ignoring customer feedback, assuming customers may not understand the complexities of your operations
    - Incorrect. Ignoring customer feedback might seem advantageous for efficiency in the short term, but it could lead to long-term negative effects, including a loss of trust. Remember, transparency and customer involvement are critical for ethical entrepreneurship.

    C) Implementing a robust data privacy policy, even if it requires more effort and cost, to respect and secure customer information
    - Correct. Implementing a thorough data privacy policy showcases a respect for your customers and secures their personal information, aligning with the principles of ethical entrepreneurship.
