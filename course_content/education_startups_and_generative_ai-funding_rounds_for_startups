1. In terms of funding, which stage is typically associated with validating the product or service in the market?

    A) Series A funding
    - Correct. Series A funding is meant for startups that have a product or service ready for market, and they often use this funding round to further test and validate their business model.
  
    B) Seed funding
    - Incorrect. Seed funding typically focuses on transforming an idea into a viable product or service, but it does not usually provide the larger amounts required for extensive market validation.
 
    C) Series C funding
    - Incorrect. While a startup's product or service must still prove successful at the Series C stage, this round is usually more about scaling their existing success, rather than initial market validation.

2. What type of investor is a start-up likely to engage with during Series B funding?

    A) Angel Investors
    - Incorrect. Angel Investors are typically involved during the seed funding stage when the risk is relatively high and large capital is not yet required.
    
    B) Venture Capital Investors
    - Correct. At the Series B stage, startups are more established and are seeking more substantial funding for expansion, which is often provided by Venture Capital investors.
    
    C) Public Shareholders
    - Incorrect. Public Shareholders become relevant when the company goes public usually after several private funding rounds, not during Series B.

3. Which funding stage would most likely fund major acquisitions or entry into new markets?

    A) Seed Funding
    - Incorrect. Seed funding is generally intended for initial developments and proving early product viability, not for making major acquisitions or entering new markets.
  
    B) Series C Funding
    - Correct. At the Series C stage, start-ups usually aim to expand their successful business model into new markets, or to acquire other companies that complement their own.
    
    C) Series A Funding
    - Incorrect. Series A funding is intended for validating the product or service in the market, and does not typically provide enough capital for major expansions or acquisitions.

4. Which funding round primarily focuses on initial product development?

    A) Seed funding
    - Correct. Seed funding targets the development of an idea into a viable product or service. At this stage, the focus is on feasibility and preparing a product or service to be market-ready.
    
    B) Series B funding
    - Incorrect. Series B funding is generally aimed at expanding market reach once the business model has been established and validated. At this stage, the product development phase has usually reached a satisfactory level.
    
    C) Series C funding
    - Incorrect. Series C funding comes into the picture when a company is already successful and looking to scale across markets, not when focusing on initial product development.

5. How does the type of investor typically change from the Seed to Series A funding stages?

    A) From venture capitalists to angel investors
    - Incorrect. The flow typically goes in the opposite direction. While angel investors often provide seed funding, venture capitalists generally start to become involved at the Series A stage.
    
    B) From angel investors to venture capitalists
    - Correct. Angel investors usually provide early, less substantial funding during the seed phase. As a startup grows, it often starts to attract the attention of venture capitalists during the Series A stage.
    
    C) From stock exchange investors to venture capitalists
    - Incorrect. Stock exchange investors usually come into play when a company goes public, which is usually after several private funding rounds, not between the Seed and Series A stages.
