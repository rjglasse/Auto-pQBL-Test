1) As a student, you encounter ChatGPT claiming that the most successful entrepreneurs are usually college dropouts. What approach should you adopt to fact check this claim?
   
    A) Cross-check the claim using a variety of reputable sources
    - Correct. This is a reliable way to fact check. Multiple sources can give you a well-rounded idea and validate the claim. AI can provide interesting pointers, which should be cross-checked for reliability.
  
    B) Assume the machine claim as accurate without cross-checking, because AI is designed to always be factual.
    - Incorrect. Although AI can process a large amount at once, it doesn't 'know' the truth. It's essential to cross-check machine claims rather than accepting them at face value.
   
    C) Dismiss the AI's claim, as AI doesnâ€™t comprehend human behavior therefore can't make valid claims.
    - Incorrect. You're right that AI does not 'understand' human behavior, but it can still generate valuable insights based on patterns in data. You should extract insights from AI, but remember to verify them against reputable sources before accepting.

2) You're brainstorming innovative techniques to strengthen student collaboration in online learning. How might you leverage ChatGPT in your brainstorming pursuits?

    A) Enter a comprehensive summary of your challenge into ChatGPT and probe the output for unique ideas and threads.
    - Correct. This confluence of the AI's pattern recognition capabilities and your human creativity might yield innovative solutions. Remember, the AI is not providing 'answers' but rather stimuli for your brainstorms.
   
    B) Feed in arbitrary words associated with your project and lift any idea from the AI output.
    - Incorrect. While you should take advantage of the AI's pattern recognition, giving it unfocused input might yield broad results without answering your specific issue. It's always better to give pertinent, focused prompts for efficient results.
  
    C) Cite the AI's output verbatim as your final idea because AI is more ingenious than humans.
    - Incorrect. Remember, AI augments human ingenuity, it doesn't replace it. The AI can offer fresh perspectives, but it's your human creativity that should infuse life into these ideas and mould them into innovative solutions.
