1. What potential ethical issues can arise from using generative AI like ChatGPT in the context of personalized learning?

    A) Generative AI could replace the traditional role of educators leading to a decreased need for teachers.
    - Incorrect. This perspective overlooks the critical function that teachers play in shaping student’s learning experience, which cannot be replaced by AI. Although AI might change teaching dynamics, its usage raises other issues like invasion of privacy, information bias, and an overreliance on technology.

    B) Generative AI could lead to challenges around data privacy (students' confidential data being exploited), biases in learning materials due to the inherent bias in training data, and an over-dependence on AI-driven personalized learning methods.
    - Correct. These are the key ethical concerns when it comes to the rise of AI in education. It is crucial to carefully consider these aspects when designing AI-driven learning solutions.

    C) Students might overly rely on AI-driven personalized learning affecting their information-processing abilities and independent thinking.
    - Incorrect. While an overdependence on AI is a valid concern, this perspective overlooks other equally critical issues like data privacy, and bias in decision-making due to skewed training data. It’s essential in the ethical debate to consider the balance of all such factors.Unit_name: Working with Generative AI

2. Question 1: You're developing an AI-assisted learning program for your school. What primary ethical concern should guide your implementation?

    A) Ensuring AI doesn’t show any bias, so all students get unbiased learning. 
    - Incorrect. AI bias is indeed an important concern and must be addressed. However, focusing exclusively on this issue might lead to neglecting other key ethical concerns such as data privacy and accountability.

    B) Keeping student data private, above all. 
    - Incorrect. Absolutely, privacy is critical, but it isn't the only concern. It's crucial to balance it with other ethical issues. Also, solely focusing on privacy might lead to neglecting other factors like AI bias or user comprehension.

    C) Simultaneously considering all ethical concerns; no single concern should take precedence.
    - Correct. Ethical implementation of AI in education involves carefully balancing a variety of factors, including privacy, AI bias, accountability and understanding. Each concern is crucial and none should be overlooked.

1. As a project team, you're thinking of incorporating an AI assistant for interactive learning. Which aspects of this decision involve ethical concerns?

    A) Potential biases in the AI's responses due to its training data.
    - Correct. Any AI training depends on its dataset. Misrepresentations or biases in this data would lead to a biased tool which is a significant ethical concern. However, it's equally important to contemplate other dimensions of this issue too i.e. data privacy and consent.

    B) Only the possibility of AI replacing human tutors.
    - Incorrect. While it's true that AI could reduce the reliance on human tutors, ethical concerns are broader and encompass issues like data privacy, consent and the potential for algorithmic bias. Reflect more about how AI may affect various dimensions of education.

    C) Ensuring that the AI assistant works perfectly without technical errors.
    - Incorrect. While functional efficiency of the AI assistant is crucial for effective learning, it's not mainly an ethical concern. Ethical debates around AI in education generally revolve around issues like data privacy, consent, and possible biases in AI responses.
