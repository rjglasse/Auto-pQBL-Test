Unit_name: Working with Generative AI
Page_name: Ethical concerns

1. What potential ethical issues can arise from using generative AI like ChatGPT in the context of personalized learning?

    A) Generative AI could replace the traditional role of educators leading to a decreased need for teachers.
    - Incorrect. This perspective overlooks the critical function that teachers play in shaping student’s learning experience, which cannot be replaced by AI. Although AI might change teaching dynamics, its usage raises other issues like invasion of privacy, information bias, and an overreliance on technology.

    B) Generative AI could lead to challenges around data privacy (students' confidential data being exploited), biases in learning materials due to the inherent bias in training data, and an over-dependence on AI-driven personalized learning methods.
    - Correct. These are the key ethical concerns when it comes to the rise of AI in education. It is crucial to carefully consider these aspects when designing AI-driven learning solutions.

    C) Students might overly rely on AI-driven personalized learning affecting their information-processing abilities and independent thinking.
    - Incorrect. While an overdependence on AI is a valid concern, this perspective overlooks other equally critical issues like data privacy, and bias in decision-making due to skewed training data. It’s essential in the ethical debate to consider the balance of all such factors.
