1. As an entrepreneur, you are designing an AI-based application to promote interactive learning in K-12 education utilizing Augmented Reality (AR). To ideate and brainstorm, you are planning to leverage GPT-3 to assist you in this process. Which of the following prompts would likely yield the most innovative and diverse range of AR applications for your cause?

    A) "Tell me about AR uses"
    - Incorrect. The prompt is too general and broad, lacks context, and is not directive towards the specific goal. A more effective approach would be to frame your prompt clearly and directly, specifying the desired context and purpose.

    B) "Discuss ways of involving AR in K-12 education"
    - Incorrect. Although this includes context (AR and K-12 education), it is still not specific or innovative. You should ask for creative and innovative uses of AR. Additionally, specifying the number of ideas you want could help generate a broader range of possibilities.

    C) "Craft ten pioneering and unique applications of Augmented Reality (AR) for promoting interactive learning in K-12 educational environments"
    - Correct. This prompt not only pertains to the specific educational context and calls for originality but also calls for a substantial number of ideas, which encourages broader thinking and the generation of diverse educational use-cases.Unit_name: Working with Generative AI

Question 1: How can you improve in crafting a more effective prompting question to extract an insightful output from a generative AI system?

A) "I need a lengthy report on the effects of climate change.”
   - Incorrect. This request lacks a specific focus that guides the AI's response. Remember, being specific is a key to extract quality outputs; try to focus on a specific aspect of climate change.

B) "Compile a concise summary on how entrepreneurship education has evolved over the decades.”
   - Correct. This request is well balanced with a specific directive ("compile a concise summary"), and focus ("how entrepreneurship education has evolved over the decades"). This will enable the AI to generate a highly relevant and quality output.

C) "Please provide a holistic analysis based on the latest developments in AI technology.”
   - Incorrect. While this is a well-formed question, it's not suitable for AI like ChatGPT because its knowledge is pre-October 2021 and it doesn't have access to real-time updates, meaning it wouldn't be able to provide an analysis of the "latest" developments. Always consider the capabilities and the limitations of the AI when formulating your prompts.
   
Remember: Always consider the aim of your prompt, the specificity and limitations of the AI when crafting your prompts to extract insightful and high-quality outputs.
