1. As an entrepreneur, you are designing an AI-based application to promote interactive learning in K-12 education utilizing Augmented Reality (AR). To ideate and brainstorm, you are planning to leverage GPT-3 to assist you in this process. Which of the following prompts would likely yield the most innovative and diverse range of AR applications for your cause?

    A) "Tell me about AR uses"
    - Incorrect. The prompt is too general and broad, lacks context, and is not directive towards the specific goal. A more effective approach would be to frame your prompt clearly and directly, specifying the desired context and purpose.

    B) "Discuss ways of involving AR in K-12 education"
    - Incorrect. Although this includes context (AR and K-12 education), it is still not specific or innovative. You should ask for creative and innovative uses of AR. Additionally, specifying the number of ideas you want could help generate a broader range of possibilities.

    C) "Craft ten pioneering and unique applications of Augmented Reality (AR) for promoting interactive learning in K-12 educational environments"
    - Correct. This prompt not only pertains to the specific educational context and calls for originality but also calls for a substantial number of ideas, which encourages broader thinking and the generation of diverse educational use-cases.
