Question 1: Which of the following methods can significantly refine the responses of a generative AI like ChatGPT?

   A) Maximizing the AI's processing speed 
   - Incorrect. Maximizing the AI's processing speed will mostly effectuate quicker responses but it doesn't particularly improve the relevancy and accuracy of responses. 

   B) Feeding it with a broader and relevant data set and iteratively giving feedback on its responses
   - Correct. By providing diverse and relevant data followed by iterative feedback on AI responses, we can enable the AI system to learn and adjust its decision mechanism, thereby refining its output.

   C) Re-utilizing the same training data over and over again with no revised feedback
   - Incorrect. Reiteration of the same data without revised feedback is less likely to bring any considerable change in AI responses. Active feedback and data diversity are key to refine the AI system.



Question 2: In applying design thinking for managing an AI project, where should the primary focus lie?

   A) Predominantly on AI system coding and technology-centric solutions
   - Incorrect. While AI coding is critical, it should not compromise the understanding of user needs and problems. Thoughtfully balancing entity development with user empathy is a more constructive approach. 

   B) On understanding the end-user's needs and maintaining a human-centric approach throughout
   - Correct. Design thinking encourages a user-centric approach. Understanding end-user needs and incorporating human factors throughout development enhance user experience, thereby enriching the overall AI solution.

   C) Solely on the commercial feasibility and scalability of the AI project
   - Incorrect. Although commercial sustainability is a key concern, it should not obscure the vision of user needs and usability. A balanced approach, keeping both user experience and commercial feasibility in check, can result in a sustainable and user-friendly AI solution.Unit_name: Working with Generative AI

Improved Question 1: To improve AI responses, what should your approach be?

    A) Set very specific instructions for the AI?
    - Incorrect. While clear instructions are important, being too specific could limit AI's creative potential. Think of it more as a collaborative effort.
    
    B) Vary your inputâ€™s structure and specificity?
    - Correct. The approach should be iterative, by experimenting with different instructions, you enable the AI to generate a range of responses.
    
    C) Accept any output the AI produces?
    - Incorrect. Blind acceptance doesn't leverage AI's full capabilities. You need to critically evaluate its output and guide it to improve.

Improved Question 2: When using AI, which factor is not crucial?

    A) Ensuring AI's fairness with varied inputs.
    - Incorrect. AI fairness is crucial. A biased AI could result in unfair treatment to certain users.
    
    B) Maintaining transparency in AI's decisions.
    - Incorrect. Transparent AI operations are crucial, helping users understand how decisions are made is necessary for resourceful AI use.
    
    C) Expecting AI to solve all problems without human assistance.
    - Correct. AI is a tool meant to work with, not replace, human abilities. Human involvement is still required for efficient problem-solving.

Improved Question 3: What is a misconception about AI's capabilities?

    A) AI can entirely replace human educators.
    - Correct. While AI can simplify and support education, it can't replicate the empathy, adaptability, and nuanced understanding of human educators.

    B) AI can mimic human emotions and behaviors perfectly.
    - Incorrect. While AI can simulate some human behaviors, it currently lacks the depth to truly grasp and replicate the full range of human emotions.

    C) AI can analyze copious amounts of data to unearth unobserved patterns.
    - Incorrect. AI has the strength to handle and analyze large sets of data, revealing intricate patterns that might get overlooked by human analysts.
